On arrival in the emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular tachycardia and was defibrillated, and required pressor medications, an intraaortic balloon pump, and ventilator support to maintain her blood pressure, as her condition affected multiple organ systems. Due to poor neurological status and poor prognosis, and in conjunction with the patient's previously expressed wishes, medical care was withdrawn on 6/14 after many discussions with family, and the intraaortic balloon pump was turned off.

On presentation to the Emergency Department, her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 189/92, pulse rate of 120, respiratory rate of 20, and an O2 sat of 90%. She was given insulin, sublingual nitroglycerin x three, 4 mg of morphine, 5 mg of Lopressor, and started on a heparin drip and IV antibiotics, and admitted to the MICU for further management. Her past medical history included insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for how many years, positive ethanol use, approximately one drink per week, and denied IV drug use or other illicit drug use. She was placed on an insulin drip and hydrated with intravenous fluids, with improvement, and eventually transitioned to NPH with insulin sliding scale coverage. Despite escalating her dose of NPH up to 65 U subcu b.i.d. on the day of discharge, she continued to have elevated blood sugars &gt;200 and required coverage with insulin sliding scale. This issue will need to be addressed as an outpatient. She was also placed on cefotaxime for gram negative coverage, with both her blood cultures and urine cultures growing out E. coli which were sensitive to cefotaxime and gentamycin. As she initially continued to be febrile and continued to have positive blood cultures, one dose of gentamycin was given for synergy, and she was eventually transitioned to p.o. levofloxacin and will take 7 days of p.o. levofloxacin to complete a total 14-day course of antibiotics for urosepsis. She was initially placed on aspirin, heparin, and a beta blocker, and once her creatinine normalized, an ACE inhibitor was also added. Heparin was discontinued once the concern for PE was alleviated, and her beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated up for a goal systolic blood pressure of &lt;140 and a pulse of &lt;70.

Her MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Avapro, Lipitor, Decadron, ranitidine, Humalog, allopurinol, Alimta, Flonase, Vitamin D, B12, and Colace. She was initially treated with vancomycin, Levaquin, and aztreonam along with Flagyl empirically, and later changed to Levaquin only on 10/25/2005 to treat an enterococcal UTI and possible nosocomial pneumonia. She had thrombocytopenia and required multiple red blood transfusions to maintain her hematocrit greater than 26, though she was never hemodynamically unstable. She also required multiple platelet transfusions to keep her platelets greater than 30,000. She responded well initially to three units of packed red blood cells over 7/28/2005 and 09. However, in the setting of her GI bleed from a sloughing mucosa secondary to resolving neutropenic enteritis and recent chemo, she required multiple further RBC transfusions to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. Hematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted platelet levels status post transfusions, which was felt to be secondary to poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo (workup was negative for other possible causes refractory thrombocytopenia, nystatin, allopurinol, were held given possible worsening of her thrombocytopenia). Surgery was consulted and she was managed conservatively with antibiotics initially and then with bowel rest. TPN was started on 4/21/2005, given her bowel rest for a neutropenic enteritis. She was changed to standing insulin on 10/25/2005 and her Lantus was up titrated along with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood sugars in the 80s to 120s.

       "'A 26-year-old male with a history of hypertension, obesity, and sleep apnea who was in a nursing home until two days prior to admission presented with shortness of breath. He also reported palpitations, cough with sputum, and right leg pain. His vital signs were temperature 101.2, pulse 110, blood pressure 128/72, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air and 98% while ambulating. Examination revealed dry mucous membranes, decreased breath sounds at the right lower base without wheezing, tachycardia, regular rhythm, and non-tender abdomen with no edema in the right calf. Labs showed a WBC of 14, MCV of 70, HCT of 47, and BNP of 2. The EKG was sinus tachycardia with T wave inversion in III and unchanged from prior. CXR was normal. The diagnosis was likely viral upper respiratory infection and the patient was given IBUPROFEN 600-800 MG PO TID PRN Pain for pain control. A lower extremity ultrasound of the right leg was negative for deep venous thrombus. The patient was discharged on 3/26/05 at 2:00 PM with instructions to resume regular exercise and follow up with his primary care doctor on October 25th. He was also advised to elevate his leg and use IBUPROFEN 600-800 MG PO TID PRN Pain as needed for pain control.'"

       "\"The patient was admitted on 5/5/2006 with a history of mechanical fall, with the attending physician being Dr. Clemente Armand Bolstad, with a full code status and disposition of Rehabilitation. Medications on Admission included Amiodarone 100 QD, Colace 100 bid, lasix 40mg QD, Glyburide 5mg bid, Plaquenil 200mg bid, Isordil 20mg tid, Lisinopril 20mg QD, Coumadin 5mg 3dys/week, 2.5mg 4dys/week, Norvasc 10mg QD, Neurontin 300mg TID, with APAP prn. An override was added on 10/2/06 by Gerad E. Dancy, PA for POTENTIALLY SERIOUS INTERACTION: AMIODARONE HCL & WARFARIN with the reason for override being monitoring. The patient was rehydrated with IVF and PO's were encouraged, holding Glypizide while in house, Novolog sliding scale was started on 1/2, Low dose NPH 6 units BID was started on 1/2, bridged with lovenox and INR therapeutic 1/2 and restarted on home regimen of 5/2.5mg variable dose. Pain was controlled with TYLENOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) 650 MG PO Q4H PRN Pain, Headache. A CT pelvis showed a right adnexal cyst which will need further characterization by US and outpatient follow up. The patient has an extensive cardiac history and the fall is not likely related to a cardiac issue as it appears mechanical, with no syncope, chest pain, etc. She was diagnosed with an NSTEMI with a small TnI leak, likely demand related in the setting of hypovolemia and the fall. Enzymes trended down. She was dry on admission and rehydrated with IVF, PO's encouraged, and became euvolemic by 1/2. Her JVP was up to 12cm, although it was difficult to gauge her volume status due to TR. She had a prolonged QT on admission, on telemetry, of unclear etiology, possibly starvation. This was monitored on telemetry until ROMI and drugs that confound were avoided. The QTc resolved to low 500s and a DDD pacer was functioning with V-pacing at 60bpm. Additional medications included NATURAL TEARS (ARTIFICIAL TEARS) 2 DROP OU BID, COLACE (DOCUSATE SODIUM) 100 MG PO BID, PLAQUENIL SULFATE (HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE) 200 MG PO BID, ISORDIL (ISOSORBIDE DINITRATE) 20 MG PO TID, LISINOPRIL 20 MG PO DAILY HOLD IF: SBP <110, MILK OF MAGNESIA (MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE) 30 MILLILITERS PO DAILY PRN Constipation, COUMADIN (WARFARIN SODIUM) 2.5 MG PO QPM, NORVASC (AMLODIPINE) 10 MG PO DAILY HOLD IF: SBP <110, NEURONTIN (GABAPENTIN) 300 MG PO TID, NEXIUM (ESOMEPRAZOLE) 20 MG PO DAILY, MAALOX-TABLETS QUICK DISSOLVE/CHEWABLE 1-2 TAB PO Q6H PRN Upset Stomach, DULCOLAX RECTAL (BISACODYL RECTAL) 10 MG PR DAILY PRN Constipation, CLOTRIMAZOLE 1% TOPICAL TOPICAL TP BID, GLYBURIDE 5 MG PO BID, LASIX (FUROSEMIDE) 20 MG PO DAILY, and corrected pt restarted on lasix 20 qd on d/c. A PT consult was obtained 3/21 and to follow daily at rehab. Labs showed Na 146, CK 3320, CKMB 12.9, Trop 0.23--->0.10, AST 107, Cr 1.2-->1.6.
