       "\"Brief Hospital Course: During the ERCP a pancreatic stent was required to facilitate access to the biliary system (removed at the end of the procedure), and a common bile duct stent was placed to allow drainage of the biliary obstruction caused by stones and sludge. However, due to the patient's elevated INR, no sphincterotomy or stone removal was performed. Frank pus was noted to be draining from the common bile duct, and post-ERCP it was recommended that the patient remain on IV Zosyn for at least a week. The Vancomycin was discontinued. On hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to ERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and bilirubin continued an upward trend. On ERCP the previous biliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary sludge and stones. As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent. At the conclusion of the procedure, retrograde cholangiogram was negative for filling defects.\""
