The\\nVancomycin was discontinued.\\n\\nOn hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to\\nERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and\\nbilirubin continued an upward trend. On ERCP the previous\\nbiliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary\\nsludge and stones. As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a\\nsphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several\\nbiliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent.
