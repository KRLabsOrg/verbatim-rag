Here are examples on how to turn a clinical note excerpt into a patient‑style question, a clinician‑style question, and the sentences needed to answer it:

{example_qas}

---

Now you are given a new clinical note excerpt from a patient’s electronic health record (EHR):

---
{note}
---

Your task is to:
1. Write **exactly one** realistic patient‑style question someone might ask after reading this note.
2. Rewrite that question in a formal, clinician‑friendly format.
3. Identify which sentences in the note are **directly and literally** used to answer your question.

Don’t repeat the note itself in your answer—only output the three fields, exactly in this format:

Patient Question: <your patient question>  
Clinician Question: <your clinician question>  
Relevant Sentences: [<num1>, <num2>, …]
