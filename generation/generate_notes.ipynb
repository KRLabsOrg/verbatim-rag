Replicate their style, header selection, noise patterns and scenario variety.\\n\\n--- Example 1 ---  \\nbrief hospital course during the ercp a pancreatic stent was required to facilitate access to the biliary system removed at the end of the procedure and a common bile duct stent was placed to allow drainage of the biliary obstruction caused by stones and sludge however due to the patients elevated inr no sphincterotomy or stone removal was performed frank pus was noted to be draining from the common bile duct and postercp it was recommended that the patient remain on iv zosyn for at least a week the vancomycin was discontinued on hospital day 4 postprocedure day 3 the patient returned to ercp for reevaluation of her biliary stent as her lfts and bilirubin continued an upward trend on ercp the previous biliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary sludge and stones as the patients inr was normalized to 12 a sphincterotomy was safely performed with removal of several biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent at the conclusion of the procedure retrograde cholangiogram was negative for filling defects\\n\\n--- Example 2 ---  \\nhistory of present illness mr known lastname 47367 is a 58yearold man with a history of aml sp allogeneic transplant 2142 complicated by graftversushost disease multiple vertebral fractures and ultimately development of paraplegia in the setting of a vertebral fracture during a code situation admitted multiple times most recently 82148 for bacteremia and upper resp infection cx staph epi and completed

performed it was decided to transition to comfort measures only on 1012 the below medical treaments lab draws and imaging procedures were held the pt was kept in iv morphine tylenol and ativan to keep comfortable he died peacefully on the morning of 21481013  pneumonia productive cough followed by somnolence in the setting of starting ambien and valium in addition to his home oxycontin cxr with lll

cxr vanco was changed to linezolid day 1 106 per id recs also question of possible pulmonary congestion so pt was started on iv lasix on 108 the pt appeared to have worsening wbc and respiratory distress he was started on ambisome and given a dose of tobramycin the tobramycin was thereafter uptitrated with little effect antibiotics were continued despite little improvement  tachycardia continues to be in sinus tachycardia in the 130s initially in the 160s but has improved with fluids likely multifactorial with pe pain hypovolemia and withdrawal from opioids all contributing he was given several doses of narcan at osh and his home narcotics were initially held in the setting of hypotension morphine drip was started to relieve any pain without any improvement in tachycardia\\n\\n--- Example 3 ---  \\ndischarge instructions you were admitted to the hospital with a partial small bowel obstruction with time your obstruction dramatically improved and you were able to eat regular food constipation will worsen your symptoms unfortunately you have trouble tolerating stool softeners and you get diarrhea very easily fiber is the most gentle treatment for constipation please take fiber supplements metamucil twice daily consider also taking  each day if you can tolerate it but start with a small dose half a scoop you will follow up with your oncologist dr  for consideration of further treatment of your bladder cancer you will also follow up with your gastroenterologist dr\\n\\n--- Example 4 --- \\nmajor surgical or invasive procedure thyroidectomy

obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed in  for which he has been on various forms of pap he has a history of noncompliance with his cpap the patient lives in a group home due to his schizophrenia where he was found almost completely unresponsive and was therefore brought to osh where initial abg resulted as 72868 a ct scan revealed a large multi nodular thyroid with compression on the trachea and the patient was transferred to  on  for further evaluation the patients hypercarbia at  was thought to be multifactorial at baseline he has longstanding severe osa with cpap noncompliance his new multinodular goiter which is compressing the trachea is likely causing upper airway obstruction that is exacerbating the pts hypoventilation ent endocrinology and sleep medicine consultants evaluated the goiter and recommended surgical removal given concern for obstruction due to tracheal compression as well as the potential for malignancy an ultrasound was performed which confirmed multinodular anatomy of goiter with tracheal compression no biopsy was taken as there was already planning to remove the thyroid importantly all teams expressed to the patient that it would be unsafe to discharge the patient prior to surgery as the patient would be at high risk to return from his group home with hypercarbic respiratory failure again which has happened multiple times after several family meetings the patient and his mother legal guardian were in agreement that surgery would be indicated on  the patient underwent thyroidectomy performed by ent postop he was transferred to the sicu
